Lecturers: Libor Zachoval and Milu Phillip.

Notes:
When doing my portfolio, I experienced problems with the way that each page looked. I started with coding and seeing it in Firefox, however this web was not working properly for me as some things didn't show up in the right places or at all. I then got some friends to look at it themselves on their computer to check if it was ok and received feedback. 

I have since fixed the problems that were showing up on other laptops and it shows correctly on my laptop, however there is a chance that it might not be correct, as there is a slight delay for my laptop to update it.

Help:
I received help from my friends Caoimhe O'Brien and Liam treacy and also my lecturer, Libor Zachoval for responsiveness.
